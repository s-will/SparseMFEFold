	Bugfixes
	Use gengetopt for command line parsing
	Rename package and program to SparseMFEFold
	Print candidate and trace arrow with option verbose (default off)
	Mark candidates by square brackets with option mark-candidates (default off)
	Produce output identitcal to RNAfold -d0 in default mode

0.2	2015-Feb-24
	RNA folding equivalent to RNAfold -d0; with space efficient
	sparsification and sparse trace-back

0.1	2015-Feb-21
	Avoid trace arrows to candidates to save more space; almost
	Zuker-like RNA folding algorithm (w/o true multi-loops)
	with space efficient sparse trace-back.
